                    <p className="text-md"> Hello! Iâ€™m from Kinston, North Carolina. I am currently a senior studying Consumer, Apparel, and Retail Studies at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. 
                        Simultaneously, I am also a part-time student in the Coding Bootcamp Program provided by The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 
                        I have over 5 years of work experience in luxury retail. I am on track to graduate in Summer 2022 at UNCG. My end goal is to be able to 
                        become an asset to a company by cultivating an experience for consumers by using my programming skills, 
                        extensive consumer research, and trend forecasting abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-md">To date, I am working diligently to increase my proficiency to become a full stack developer.
                        You are more than welcome to follow along with my progress as I continue to learn in this awesomely 
                        intense program.
